<h2 style="color:#9933ff;text-align:center";><font face = "Comic sans MS;">by Ella Wheeler Wilcox</h2>

<em><strong>Life is a privilege</em></strong><br>
<p style="color:#9933ff;text-align:center;">Its youthful days<br>
			Shine with the radiance of continuous Mays.<br>
			To live, to breathe, to wonder and desire,<br>
			To feed with dreams the heart's perpetual fire,<br>
			To thrill with virtuous passions, and to glow<br>
			With great ambitions - in one hour to know<br>
			The depths and heights of feeling-<br>
				&dagger; God &dagger; <br>
				In truth,<br>
			How beautiful, how beautiful is youth!</br>
<br></br>
		<p style="color:#FF00FF;text-align:center";> <em> <strong> Life is a privilege </em></strong><br> 
<p style="color:#9933ff;text-align:center">Like some rare rose<br>
    The mysteries of the human mind unclose.<br>
    What marvels lie in earth, and air, and sea!<br>
    What stores of knowledge wait our opening key!<br>
    What sunny roads of happiness lead out<br>
    Beyond the realms of indolence and doubt!<br>
    And what large pleasures smile upon and bless<br>
    The busy avenues of usefulness!</br>
<br></br>
		<p style="color:#FF00FF;text-align:center";> <em> <strong> Life is a privilege </em></strong><br> 
<p style="color:#9933ff;text-align:center">Though noontide fades<br>
    And shadows fall along the winding glades,<br>
    Though joy-blooms wither in the autumn air,<br>
    Yet the sweet scent of sympathy is there.<br>
    Pale sorrow leads us closer to our kind,<br>
    And in the serious hours of life we find<br>
    Depths in the souls of men which lend new worth<br>
    And majesty to this brief span of earth.</br>
<br></br>
		<p style="color:#FF00FF;text-align:center";> <em> <strong> Life is a privilege </em></strong><br> 
<p style="color:#9933ff;text-align:center">If some sad fate<br>
    Sends us alone to seek the exit gate,<br>
    If men forsake us and as shadows fall,<br>
    Still does the supreme privilege of all<br>
    Come in that reaching upward of the soul<br>
    To find the welcoming Presence at the goal,<br>
    And in the Knowledge that our feet have trod<br>
    Paths that led from, and must wind back,<br>to<br> &dagger; God &dagger;</br>
